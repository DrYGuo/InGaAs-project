The Matlab programs are for measuring compositions in InxGa(1-x)As from the intensity ratio I(-1,11,1)/I(1,11,1) under the three-beam condition,
which is detailed in the paper by Guo et al (2019) (in preparation). Two examples of experimental CBED patterns are given in the list.
The (4 0 0) vector must be in the horizontal direction. The Ratio_measurement.m measures the ratio by carrying out a linear background subtraction.
The thickness_measurement_trial.m extracts the thickness information. This program may give a flawed thickness value, unless the surface plot is 
carefully examined. A JEMS simulaiton is preferred to accompany this code for thickness evaluation. A further update of the thickness measurement may involve deep learning.
