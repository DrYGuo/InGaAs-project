This Blochwave program was written by Dr Yueming Guo at Monash University.
Most of the notations in this code have been adopted from the book by Zuo & Spence (2016). The conventions for Sg,direction of zone axis follows his own thesis. Please see Fig.2.2 in Guo's PhD thesis(2017). https://monash.figshare.com/articles/Three-beam_electron_diffraction_for_structural_investigations/4736596. In Chapter 2 of Guo's thesis, a more detailed derivation of the Blochwave approach is given. 
For calculating elastic scattering, change the atomic displacements in the fifth column in the structure files,<u^2>(for Debye-waller factor),to 0. Do not leave it blank!

The functions, faR.m, BIQINT.m, CINT.m and QQINT.m were translated from the Fortran program, which were retrieved from Bird D.M., King Q.A.Absorptive form factors for high energy electron diffraction. Acta Cryst., A46 (1990), pp. 202-208.
