This Blochwave program was written by Dr Yueming Guo at Monash University.
Most of the notations in this code have been adopted from the book by Zuo & Spence (2016). The conventions for Sg,direction of zone axis follows his own thesis. Please see Fig.2.2 in Guo's PhD thesis(2017). https://monash.figshare.com/articles/Three-beam_electron_diffraction_for_structural_investigations/4736596. In Chapter 2 of Guo's thesis, a more detailed derivation of the Blochwave approach is given. 
For calculating elastic scattering, change the atomic displacements in the fifth column in the structure files,<u^2>(for Debye-waller factor),to 0. Do not leave it blank!
