# InGaAs-project
The InGaAs-project accompanies the paper by Yueming Guo, Ding Peng, Philip N.H. Nakashima, Joanne Etheridge (2019) (in preparation).
A new method for local composition measurement in zince-blende structures has been developed. The matlab programs 
in this project aim for automatic extraction of local composition in InGaAs from the designed experiement of 
convergent-beam electron diffraction (CBED). Simulation of CBED intensities can be carried out using the Matlab programs 
in the folder "Calculation of intensity ratios by Bloch wave".
